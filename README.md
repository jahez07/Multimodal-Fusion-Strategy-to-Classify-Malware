# Multimodal-Fusion-Strategy-to-Classify-Malware
This work focuses on proposing a novel approach towards classifying malware binaries by extracting visual features from malware executables. 

## Step 1 : 
Preparing Dataset. 
The dataset used in this work is from Kaggle Challenge for Malware Classification, Big2015

Big2015 Malware Dataset consists of 9 families and 10,868 malware binary samples. Big2015 is a highly unbalanced dataset, with few families having more than 2000 malware samples, few more 1000 and others below 500.
