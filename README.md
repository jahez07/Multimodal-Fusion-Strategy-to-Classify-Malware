# Multimodal-Fusion-Strategy-to-Classify-Malware
This work focuses on proposing a novel approach towards classifying malware binaries by extracting visual features from malware executables. 

The dataset used in this work is from Kaggle Challenge for Malware Classification, Big2015.

Big2015 Malware Dataset consists of 9 families and 10,868 malware binary samples. Big2015 is a highly unbalanced dataset, with few families having more than 2000 malware samples, few more 1000 and others below 500. 

## Experiment 1 : 
First malware visual representation we use in this work is Grayscale image, which is generated using the decimal represenation of the hex code that was extracted from the malware executables using Hex Dump Tool.

The above image is an example snippet of the hexadecimal values extracted from Hex codes of a malware sample. The hexadecimal is again converted into decimal as shown bellow.

```bash
  pip install pyqlib
